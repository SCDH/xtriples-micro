# Packages

If you want to use this XTriples processor in CI/CD pipelines or in
your downstream X-processing projekt, do not clone this repo or use
git submodules. No! Use a **released package** instead!

- Only for released packages you get **quality** that comes from the
  complete software development cycle of development and testing.
- By using package versions, you make your your setup **reproducible**.
- You get what you need, but not do **not get polluted** with test suites,
  infrastructure code etc. which you would get by git's bloody
  submodules.
